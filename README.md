# Eye-Exercise
## Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events!
Some of these events are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>click: Triggered when the mouse is clicked</li>
  <li>mousemove: Triggered when the mouse moves over an element</li>
  <li>mouseleave: Triggered when mouse the leaves an element</li>
</ul>
<img src= "eye.png" width ='300'/>

## Future Improvements
I would like be able to add a yellow circle in front of Pacman's mouth to emulate the original Pacman games a little more.
